# Southeast Conservation Blueprint Indicators

These datasets were prepared as part of the Southeast Blueprint Explorer data
preparation process (`secas-blueprint/analysis/prep/prepare_base_blueprint.py`).

These are 30 meter data aligned to the Base Blueprint extent used in this tool.

Value labels were modified to be appropriate as column names.
