# Sea-level rise

These datasets were prepared from the same source data as the Southeast Blueprint
Explorer. See `secas-blueprint/source_data/slr/README.md` for more information.

These data were rasterized from polygon data to a 30 meter resolution aligned to
the Base Blueprint extent used in this tool. Only polygons and holes that are
bigger than 1/2 the area of a 30 meter pixel were retained during processing.
