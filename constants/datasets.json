The Low level of urbanization includes areas where at least 50% of the runs predicted that a pixel will convert to urban, and the High level of urbanization corresponds to areas where any of the runs predicted that a pixel will urbanize.  To calculate the total amount of urbanization within each population analysis area, the proportion of stochastic urbanization simulations that predict urbanization for a given pixel is multiplied by the area associated with each proportion."
