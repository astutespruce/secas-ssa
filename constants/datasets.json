The probability of urbanization for each area reflects how many times it urbanized out of 50 model runs.  Limited to the inland continental Southeast.",

To calculate the total amount of urbanization within each analysis area, the proportion of stochastic urbanization simulations that predict urbanization for a given pixel is multiplied by the area associated with each proportion.",

The first, landscape diversity, reflects the number of microhabitats and climatic gradients created by topography, elevation, and hydrology. The second, local connectedness, reflects the degree of habitat fragmentation and strength of barriers to species movement. Highly resilient sites contain many different habitat niches that support biodiversity, and allow species to move freely through the landscape to find suitable microclimates as the climate changes.
