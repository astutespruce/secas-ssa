By restricting the natural movement of sediment, shoreline armoring increases erosion, prevents the inland migration of coastal ecosystems in response to sea-level rise, and degrades habitat for birds, sea turtles, fish, plants, and other species both on and offshore. Natural shorelines in harder-to-develop coastal areas receive the highest shoreline condition scores, while hardened shorelines receive the lowest scores.

      "description": "This indicator depicts an area's capacity to maintain species diversity and ecosystem function in the face of climate change. It measures two factors that influence resilience. The first, landscape diversity, reflects the number of microhabitats and climatic gradients created by topography, elevation, and hydrology. The second, local connectedness, reflects the degree of habitat fragmentation and strength of barriers to species movement. Highly resilient sites contain many different habitat niches that support biodiversity, and allow species to move freely through the landscape to find suitable microclimates as the climate changes. This indicator originates from The Nature Conservancy's Resilient Land data.",
