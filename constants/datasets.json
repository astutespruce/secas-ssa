      "description": "This indicator uses remote sensing to estimate the number of times an area has been burned from 2013 to 2021. Many Southeastern ecosystems rely on regular, low-intensity fires to maintain habitat, encourage native plant growth, and reduce wildfire risk. This indicator combines burned area layers from both U.S. Geological Survey Landsat data and the inter-agency Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity program. Landsat-based fire predictions within the range of longleaf pine are also available through Southeast FireMap.",

      "description": "This indicator depicts an area's capacity to maintain species diversity and ecosystem function in the face of climate change. It measures two factors that influence resilience. The first, landscape diversity, reflects the number of microhabitats and climatic gradients created by topography, elevation, and hydrology. The second, local connectedness, reflects the degree of habitat fragmentation and strength of barriers to species movement. Highly resilient sites contain many different habitat niches that support biodiversity, and allow species to move freely through the landscape to find suitable microclimates as the climate changes. This indicator originates from The Nature Conservancy's Resilient Land data.",
