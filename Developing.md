# SECAS Southeast Species Status Landscape Assessment Tool - Local Development

## Architecture

This uses a data processing pipeline in Python to prepare all spatial data for use in this application.

The user interface is creating using GatsbyJS as a static web application.

The API is implemented in Python and provides summary reports for pre-defined summary units and user-defined areas.

## Development

Python dependencies are managed using `uv`. First,
[install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then:

```bash
uv venv .venv --python 3.12
<source it according to your shell, e.g., source .venv/bin/activate.fish>
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

To check for outdated dependencies and upgrade them:

```bash
uv pip list --outdated

# install latest version
uv pip install -U <packages>
```

To update the requirements.txt file used to build these dependencies into the API
Docker container for deployment, run:

```bash
uv pip compile -U pyproject.toml -o ../secas-docker/docker/api/secas-ssa-requirements.txt
```
