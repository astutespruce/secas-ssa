# SECAS Southeast Species Status Landscape Assessment Tool - Pilot

This pilot application is intended to support
[Species Status Assessments](https://www.fws.gov/project/species-status-assessment)
conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the Southeastern U.S. by
providing summaries of standardized landscape-level indicators for each analysis
unit of a given species, which may be population units, representation units, or
other areas.

It directly leverages related work on the
[SECAS Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer](https://github.com/astutespruce/secas-blueprint)
which is available online at https://blueprint.geoplatform.gov/southeast/
